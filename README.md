# Udemy - Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide

I made this repository for the programming practical of [Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/) course by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/)

## Overview

In my opinion, Flutter is the best cross-platform UI toolkit which use Dart Languange. Instead of using Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS), and Javascript (Web) , it's better to use Flutter framework for developing many platform in single implementation.

## Language/SDK/Emulator Version

All application work with the following languages and SDK version on my Windows OS.

| Language/SDK/Emulator | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| Flutter | [2.2.3](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases?tab=windows) |
| Dart | [2.13.4](https://dart.dev/guides/language/evolution#dart-213) |
| Android API Level | [28 (Android 9.0 - Pie)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie) |
| JDK | [16.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) |

## Supported Plugins

I highly recommend this supported plugin for the best experience of debug, run, and test application.
